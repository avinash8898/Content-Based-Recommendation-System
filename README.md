**Overview**

This project implements a Content-Based Recommendation System that suggests similar items to users based on their preferences. The system utilizes TF-IDF Vectorization, Cosine Similarity, and difflib to compute the similarity between items and recommend the most relevant ones.

**Features**
Preprocesses text data using TF-IDF Vectorization
Computes similarity scores between items using Cosine Similarity
Finds the most relevant matches using difflib
Provides recommendations based on content similarity

**Technologies Used**

Python
scikit-learn (for TF-IDF Vectorization and similarity computation)
difflib (for approximate string matching)
pandas (for data handling and preprocessing)
numpy (for numerical operations)

**Installation**
1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/avinash8898/Content-Based-Recommendation-System.git
cd Content-Based-Recommendation-System

2.Install required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
